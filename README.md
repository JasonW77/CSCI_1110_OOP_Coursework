_this repository contains my coursework for CSCI 1110 - Object Oriented Programming at Southwest Tech. I am using this repository to save my assignments, as well as to use those assignments as a portfolio for future potential employers._

*(Bio Goes Here)*

_I am taking this program because I have always had an aptitude and keen interest in programing and thought that it was about time I did something about it. 
I would love to work as a programmer or at the least be able to create my own programs._
